# DEPLOYMENT AND USAGE

1. Copy Paste and overwrite all the files.
2. Change the used skin in OTRS admin SysConfig Panel.
3. Now each user can select the theme from his preferences Menu, by clicking on the name (usually top right corner).


*NOTE*: You wonâ€™t be able to use any other skin after applying this package. Take a backup of your files if you ever need to revert back to some other skin or need to update your OTRS version in the future.
